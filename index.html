        <p>I would like to make a website that discusses about Kristaps Porzingus, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White and how they are the real stars for the Celtics. Obviously Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the superstars of the team, but wouldn't be as succesful as they are this season without the help of the three all-stars they play beside. The home page will just talk about the Celtics current success and a simple reason why that is. Then each player will have their own page discussing his impact to the team.</p>
